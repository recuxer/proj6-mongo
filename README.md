Simple list of dated memos kept in MongoDB database

## Description:

***Revision Author***: John Nemeth

***Class***: CIS322

***Description***: When the client goes to the index, the list of 
memos currently in the database is listed in date order (earlier 
first). There is a button that will expand a field that allows for 
a new memo to be entered in the database(animation implemented using jquery).
To remove a memo from the mLab database, there is a remove button
in the same box as the memo. If date, time, or memo is left 
blank upon sumbission of a newly created memo, a flashed message 
will appear on the page and no memo will be entered into the database.
This is a 'wireframe' page.
